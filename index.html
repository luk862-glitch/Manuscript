                <h2> Reading Excerpt: Style is not a Four Letter Word" by Mr. Keedy </h2>
                <p>Instead of marginalizing their relationship to style, designers should be capitalizing on their role in developing it. Although they are unlikely to admit it, designers
                    are implicit stylists and tastemakers. If they don’t articulate this role explicitly, they won’t have much to offer in the age of aesthetics. Culture is expressed and understood
                    through style, which is mostly created and evaluated by designers. In terms of aesthetics, art pretty much had the run of the twentieth century. Now in the twenty-first
                    century, it’s design’s turn.We don’t need a new style or a clearly defined “period style.” Nor do we have to proclaim there are “no more rules” or that we should all go off on
                    our own little “autonomous” way.There is no shortage of marginalized artistic geniuses in the world. But if there are going to be design experts in the twenty-first century,
                    what will they be experts in? Graphic designers claim that their expertise is in problem solving, communicating, organizing information, and branding. So to whom
                    should people go for style and taste? Isn’t style too important to be left in the hands of amateurs?

                <h2>Reading Response</h2>
                <p>In Style is not a Four Letter Word by Mr. Keedy, he discusses the tension between style and function in design. He contrasts his own perspective with figures like architect Adolf Loos, who believes that ornament such as carvings and tattoos is wasteful and degenerate, believing that its absence represents intellectual advancement and societal progress. 
                    I disagree with Loos’s claim that “lack of ornament is a sign of intellectual power,” since it dismisses the deep connection between craft and culture. While I understand that minimalist design can express sophistication and is often more cost effective than ornamented work, ornamentation itself plays a crucial role in preserving cultural identity and history. For instance, Loos mentions that a Chinese carver spends twice as much time on their craft compared to an American laborer, framing this as wasted time, cost, and effort. I see it differently since the carver’s work requires sophisticated technical skills and cultural knowledge, carrying meanings that connect generations. 
                    Loos’s criticism of tattoos also struck me, especially because it reminded me of the Taiwanese indigenous group Atayal. I grew up in Taiwan and learned about their culture, so I understand how deeply meaningful their tattoos are. The tattoos symbolize spiritual recognition, social status, honor, and proof of skill. Dismissing them as “degenerate” overlooks the layers of meaning embedded in these practices and the role they play in sustaining a living cultural tradition.
                    However, it’s not only ornamental objects that shape culture, Even functional designs like iPhones significantly influence how we communicate and consume media. This reinforces Keedy’s point that “design is a cultural practice.” I agree with his view that design, whether ornamental or purely functional, is never just superficial or problem-solving. It also expresses identity, embodies values, and helps define how culture evolves over time.
