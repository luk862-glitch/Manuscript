                <h2>Adolf Loos's legacy </h2>
            <section>
                <p>There has been a long and continuing feud in design between style and content, form and function, and even pleasure and utility, 
                    to which Charles Eames answered, “Who would say that pleasure is not useful?” Maybe we should call a truce, since it doesn’t seem
                     like anyone is winning. Animosity towards style is pretty much a given in the design rhetoric of the twentieth century. But where
                      did this antagonistic relationship between design and style come from? And more importantly, what has it done for us? 
                </p>
        </section>

                <section>
                <p>At the end of the stylistic excess and confusion of the Victorian era, the architect Adolf Loos led the way to a simpler, progressive, 
                    and more profitable future. In 1908 he proclaimed, “I have discovered the following truth and presented it to the world: <em>cultural 
                        evolution is synonymous with the removal of ornament from articles in daily use.</em> In his polemical and now famous essay “Ornament
                         and Crime,” Adolf Loos established what would be the prevalent attitude towards ornament, pattern, decoration, and style in the 
                         twentieth century. He explained, “Shall every age have a style of its own and our age alone be denied one? By style they meant 
                         decoration. But I said, don’t weep! See, what makes our culture grand is its inability to produce a new form of decoration. 
                         We have overcome the ornament, we have won through the lack of ornamentation.” Far from being a period without style, or new 
                         ornament, the end of the nineteenth century was inundated with ornament and style. The Jugendstil,Vienna Secession, Wiener 
                         Werkstätte, Art Nouveau, and Arts and Crafts were all in various stages of development. Loos was frustrated because a consensus 
                         on style no longer seemed possible, and he believed that “those who measure everything by the past impede the cultural development 
                         of nations and of humanity itself.” Sounding like an early example of “compassionate conservatism,” he explains, “I suffer the 
                         ornament of the Kafir, that of the Persian, that of the Slovak farmer’s wife, the ornaments of my cobbler, because they all have 
                         no other means of expressing their full potential.” Loos’s condescending conceit became “received wisdom” in modernist design, 
                         in which “<em>the lack of ornament is a sign of intellectual power.</em>” 
                </p>

                <p>In “Ornament and Crime,” we see the modernist project as fundamentalist, puritanical, elitism being promoted as progressive enlightenment. 
                    Probably very few designers have actually read it, yet they all know that ornament and style are, if not criminal, at least suspect. As 
                    Loos points out,“<em>The modern man who tattoos himself is a criminal or a degenerate.</em>There are prisons where eighty percent of 
                    the inmates bear tattoos.Those who are tattooed but are not imprisoned are latent criminals or degenerate aristocrats. If a tattooed 
                    person dies at liberty, it is only that he died a few years before he committed a murder.” And, “The man who daubs the walls with erotic 
                    symbols to satisfy an inner urge is a criminal or a degenerate. It is obvious that his urge overcomes such a man: such symptoms of 
                    degeneration most forcefully express themselves in public conveniences.”The idea that ornament, style, and pleasure are “degenerate” 
                    is reinforced today by the fact that pop culture literally wallows in them. The easiest way to differentiate yourself from the 
                    all-pervasive “nobrow”3 monoculture we inhabit is to reject its excesses. Just say “no”—to ornament and style. But for Loos, the fact 
                    that ornament was a symptom of “degenerate” sensibilities was not its worst offence. The biggest problem he had with ornament was that 
                    it was not economical. As he explained,“<em>Decorated plates are expensive, while white crockery, which is pleasing to the modern 
                    individual, is cheap. Whilst one person saves money, the other becomes insolvent</em>,” since “<em>the lack of ornament results 
                    in reduced working hours and an increased wage. The Chinese carver works sixteen hours, the American laborer works eight hours.</em>”
                    4 For Loos the modern American way, <em>without ornament (or style and history), was not only the most progressive; it was the most 
                        cost-effective.</em> Not surprisingly, Loos’s style of boxy masses of marble, glass, and wood became the style of corporate America.
                </p>

                <p>Loos was successful at discrediting style and elevating function and economics as the primary goals in design as opposed to older ideas 
                    like “truth, beauty, and power.” But he did not achieve his main goal of eliminating ornament. As James Trilling points out in his book, 
                    Ornament, A Modern Perspective, “He did something much more original. He reinvented it, with a completely new character and direction 
                    for the twentieth century.”6 He did this by carefully choosing natural substances like marble and wood for their decorative surface 
                    effects, which were natural and therefore “authentic.” Loos invented “an ornament without images, patterns, motifs, or history. Even 
                    this was not enough. Cloaking his achievement in a diatribe against ornament itself, he gave us the only ornament we could pretend was 
                    no ornament at all. We went after the decoy and swallowed it whole, a feat of self-deception that shapes our visual culture to this day.”

                <h2> Designer’s Role </h2>
                <p>Instead of marginalizing their relationship to style, designers should be capitalizing on their role in developing it. Although they are 
                    unlikely to admit it, designers are implicit stylists and tastemakers. If they don’t articulate this role explicitly, they won’t have 
                    much to offer in the age of aesthetics. <strong>Culture is expressed and understood through style, which is mostly created and evaluated by 
                    designers.</strong> In terms of aesthetics, art pretty much had the run of the twentieth century. Now in the twenty-first century, it’s design’s 
                    turn. We don’t need a new style or a clearly defined “period style.” Nor do we have to proclaim there are “no more rules” or that we should 
                    all go off on our own little “autonomous” way. There is no shortage of marginalized artistic geniuses in the world. But if there are going to 
                    be design experts in the twenty-first century, what will they be experts in? Graphic designers claim that their expertise is in problem 
                    solving, communicating, organizing information, and branding. So to whom should people go for style and taste? Isn’t style too important to be left in the hands of amateurs?

                <h2>Reading Response</h2>
                <p>In Style is not a Four Letter Word by Mr. Keedy, he discusses the tension between style and function in design. He contrasts his own perspective with figures like architect Adolf Loos, who believes that ornament such as carvings and tattoos is wasteful and degenerate, believing that its absence represents intellectual advancement and societal progress. </p>
                <p>I disagree with Loos’s claim that “lack of ornament is a sign of intellectual power,” since it dismisses the deep connection between craft and culture. While I understand that minimalist design can express sophistication and is often more cost effective than ornamented work, ornamentation itself plays a crucial role in preserving cultural identity and history. For instance, Loos mentions that a Chinese carver spends twice as much time on their craft compared to an American laborer, framing this as wasted time, cost, and effort. I see it differently since the carver’s work requires sophisticated technical skills and cultural knowledge, carrying meanings that connect generations. 
                    Loos’s criticism of tattoos also struck me, especially because it reminded me of the Taiwanese indigenous group Atayal. I grew up in Taiwan and learned about their culture, so I understand how deeply meaningful their tattoos are. The tattoos symbolize spiritual recognition, social status, honor, and proof of skill. Dismissing them as “degenerate” overlooks the layers of meaning embedded in these practices and the role they play in sustaining a living cultural tradition. </p>

                   </blockquote>
                <p> It’s not only ornamental objects that shape culture, Even functional designs like iPhones significantly influence how we communicate and consume media. This reinforces Keedy’s point that “<strong>design is a cultural practice.</strong>” I agree with his view that design, whether ornamental or purely functional, is never just superficial or problem-solving. It also expresses identity, embodies values, and helps define how culture evolves over time.
